	<!-- 
	
	currency
	You can write currency just by itself to get dollar amounts for values. You can also add a colon and a symbol
	to change the symbol for the currency, replacing the dollar sign.

	date
	Using just the word date puts the date information in the standard format. Adding a colon and some additional
	formatting information you can change the date's format. Like putting :'yyyy' after the date, it will display
	just the four-digit year. Can do :'MM' for month or :'yyyy-MM' for year and month. Can even use :'medium'

	uppercase
	Puts everything in uppercase

	lowercase
	Puts everything in lowercase

	limitTo
	Can be used to limit the number of iterations performed by the ng-repeat. limitTo:2 will limit it to 2.

	orderBy
	Can be used to order by different variables of objects, like orderBy:'name' to order by the names of the
	customers below.

	You can setup an ng-click on the table headers and a sortBy variable to make the table sort by the clicked
	header. The reverse option allows the information to be displayed in ascending or descending order.

	filter
	Allows you to filter by what is in a model, like the customerFilter model, for example. By default, so 
	just with your model as customerFilter, it will filter on all of the variables of the object. But you can 
	restrict it to customerFilter.name to only keep the name to filter on.
